# Codingame Pacman Spring Challenge 2020
My code for the weeklong Codingame Spring 2020 Challenge: https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020
Ranked in Gold League and #250 overall by final day.

Since I didn't use git during the challenge, I ended up saving versions of my code from time to time for each league. 
You can see the evolution of the code in it.

Also included is a rough Document that I used while coding for braindumps.

# Game Description:
This game is based on Pac-man, with a unique rock-paper-scissors twist.

## Statement ##
Control a team of pacs and eat more pellets than your opponent. Beware, an enemy pac just might be waiting around the corner to take a bite out of you!
